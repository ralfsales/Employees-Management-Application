HR Manager Program
The HR Manager program is a comprehensive employee data management system designed to streamline HR operations. Over three weeks, I developed key functionalities such as adding, searching, sorting, editing, and deleting employee records. The project focused on security, efficiency, and scalability to address the unique challenges of handling sensitive employee data.

Key Features
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensures only authorized roles, such as HR managers, have access to sensitive data.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adds an additional security layer.
Audit Logs: Tracks access history to prevent misuse.
Data Encryption: Secures data at rest and in transit using robust encryption techniques.
Data Minimization: Collects and stores only necessary information, with retention policies and anonymization techniques in place.
Security Measures
Encrypted database for secure storage.
Regular security audits and firewalls to protect against external threats.
Employee anti-phishing training to mitigate human risks.
Challenges Addressed
One of the primary challenges was preventing data leakage, which could lead to severe financial and legal consequences. By implementing stringent security measures, this risk was effectively minimized.

Future Enhancements
The current reliance on file-based storage limits scalability. Future updates could involve migrating to a database system for improved performance and handling larger datasets.

This program represents my commitment to developing secure, efficient, and reliable HR management solutions.
